This project, "The Race for Space," is a data analysis of 65 years of global space exploration, built using Tableau. It visualizes key trends like mission success rates, space travel milestones, rocket reliability, and cost reductions, highlighting the evolution from the Space Race to commercial space ventures. Tableau was used to create an engaging and interactive dashboard to showcase these insights effectively.
